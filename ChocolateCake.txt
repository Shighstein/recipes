2 c        Sugar        
3/4 c        Cocoa Powder

2 tsp        Baking Soda        
1/4 tsp        Salt

1/2 c        Oil






Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour, Pam is good too, or line with a piece of parchment paper cut to size, two 9 inch cake pans or a 9x13. (For the cake pans, I do the paper because it makes it easy to get the cake out.)


Mix all dry ingredients together. Add milk, coffee, oil, eggs, and vanilla.


Beat until smooth. Pour into pans. (Note: batter is runny.)


Bake 25 mins for cake pans, maybe longer for 9x13.
